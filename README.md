# Feedback App using Python Flask and SQLAlchemy

Simple Flask notes app to practice and develop a better understanding of the Flask framework and databases.

After watching the youtube tutorial by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w25ea_I89iM) on how to make a feedback app with python, this is my take on a notes app to consolidate what I learned without following a tutorial.
